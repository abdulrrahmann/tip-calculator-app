### What I learned

For this challenges, i learned how to extract data from inputs and check for validation of the data. for example, a user cannot select number of people less than or equal to 0.
also, i learned how to show an input field triggered with user click to a specific button that's was a new idea for me.
finally, i learned how to show data whenever the user finish all the input fields and select a tip amount and clear the data if the user click on "clear" button.
